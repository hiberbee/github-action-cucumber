Feature: Automate Kubernets cluster testing with Cucumber

  Scenario: Kubernetes connection
    Given context is 'minikube'
    And namespace is 'kube-system'
    When I get secrets
    Then list size is greater then 15
    And contains resource with 'metadata.name' is equal to 'default-token-'
    When I get pods
    Then list size is greater then 7
    And contains resource with 'metadata.name' is equal to 'kube-apiserver-'
    When I get services
    Then list size is greater then 1
    And contains resource with 'metadata.name' is equal to 'kubernetes'
    When I get ingresses
    Then list size is greater then 0
    When I get deployments
    Then list size is greater then 0
    When I get replica sets
    Then list size is greater then 1
    When I get daemon sets
    Then list size is greater then 0
    When I get stateful sets
    Then list size is greater then 0
